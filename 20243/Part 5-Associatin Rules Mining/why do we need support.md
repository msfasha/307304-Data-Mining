The main problem with **support alone** is that it only tells us how frequently items appear together, but it doesn't tell us anything about the **strength or direction of the relationship** between items.

## The Problem with Support

Support measures popularity, not association strength. Just because two items appear together frequently doesn't mean there's a meaningful relationship - they might just both be popular items that appear in many transactions by coincidence.

## Example Using Your Data

Let's use the transaction data from your slide:

**Support values:**
- Support({Bread}) = 60%
- Support({Milk}) = 50% 
- Support({Bread, Milk}) = 30%

**The problem:** Support tells us that bread and milk appear together in 30% of transactions, but this doesn't answer the key business question: **"Does buying bread make someone more likely to buy milk?"**

## Why We Need Confidence

Confidence answers this question by measuring the conditional probability:

**Confidence(Bread → Milk) = Support({Bread, Milk}) / Support({Bread})**
**= 30% / 60% = 50%**

This tells us: "Of all customers who buy bread, 50% also buy milk."

## Concrete Business Scenario

Imagine you're a store manager deciding whether to:
1. Place milk near the bread section to increase cross-selling
2. Create a "bread + milk" promotional bundle

**Support alone says:** "Bread and milk appear together in 30% of transactions - that's pretty common!"

**But confidence reveals:** "Only 50% of bread buyers also buy milk."

Now compare this to another rule from your data:
**Confidence(Butter → Cheese) = Support({Butter, Cheese}) / Support({Butter})**
**= 40% / 50% = 80%**

This means 80% of butter buyers also buy cheese!

## The Business Decision

- **Bread → Milk**: 50% confidence - moderate association
- **Butter → Cheese**: 80% confidence - strong association

**Conclusion:** You should prioritize placing cheese near butter (or creating butter+cheese bundles) over bread+milk combinations, even though bread+milk has the same support (30%) as butter+cheese (40%).

Support would have led you to treat these associations equally, but confidence reveals that the butter-cheese relationship is much stronger and more actionable for business decisions.

This is why confidence is essential - it transforms raw co-occurrence data into actionable insights about customer behavior patterns.
