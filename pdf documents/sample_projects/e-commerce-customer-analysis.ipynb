Problem Defining (ASK)\n\n#### **1.1 Background**\nThis synthetic dataset offers information about each transaction within an online marketplace, including customer demographics such as gender and age, as well as purchase data. While it may not provide exhaustive customer details, it encompasses essential information crucial for analysis. Specifically designed to facilitate analytical and predictive purposes, it enables tasks such as trend analysis, examination of purchase behavior, market basket analysis, and customer churn prediction. By leveraging this dataset, companies and analysts can explore the dynamics of online consumer behavior, deriving valuable insights to inform strategic decision-making in e-commerce.\n\nFor this project, the main focus will be on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) from various angles, including customer demographics, products, sales timeline, etc. Additionally, based on the findings, business recommendations and marketing strategies will be provided.\n\n#### **1.2 Potential stakeholders**\n* CEO of the company\n* Sales or account executives\n* Marketing and product team\n\n#### **1.3 Questions to address**\nDuring the ask phase of data analysis, it is crucial to consider your stakeholders and determine what type of information may be most valuable to them. In real-world situations, I would suggest requesting a quick meeting with the stakeholders and relevant teams to solicit their advice and input on the matter. This approach would enable me to better comprehend the questions or challenges they've encountered and assist in refining the areas and topics I intend to explore further during the analysis.\n\nFor the purpose of this practice, I have formulated some questions that I believe would be beneficial for growing the business and gaining a better understanding of the customer pool: \n\n1. Are there any trends regarding customer's demographics (age/gender)?\n2. Which time of the year or season tends to have the most sales? Any particular product that stands out?\n3. How can we determine if a customer is high value(potential)?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Data Preperation (PREPARE)\n\n#### **2.1 Data source, integrity, and limitations**\nThe dataset, downloaded from Kaggle and offered by SHRIYASH JAGTAP, is licensed under the Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL). This license ensures that the dataset complies with open data principles, allowing for its unrestricted use, sharing, and modification. Furthermore, the dataset was last updated 5 months ago and has been awarded a usability score of 10.0 by Kaggle, indicating its currency and high credibility.\n\n**About the data** \n* File name: \"ecommerce_customer_data_large.csv\"\n* File size: 21.29 MB\n* The dataset is synthetically generated using the Faker Python library and may not accurately represent real-world data.  \n* It contains 13 columns with each row recording a completed transaction that includes customer information, demographics, purchase history, product information, payment mothod, return and churn statuses. Each vaiable(column) is explained in the metadata. \n\n**Data Limitations** \n* **Location/Country** - Information regarding the customer's location or the origin of the purchase is not provided. This would be valuable for understanding the geographical distribution of customers and identifying market opportunities in different locations.\n* **Product ID/Name** - The information about what the product is for each transaction is unavailable.\n* **Return details unknown** - No details regarding the quantity and price that the customer returned. \n* **Transaction ID unavailable** - Each row in the dataset represents a product transaction made by a customer. However, the absence of a transaction ID prevents us from determining whether the customer's transaction at the same time and day includes purchases of different product types. This information can only be obtained if there is a transaction ID for matching and verification. \n    * To address this concern, I began by grouping transactions based on `Customer ID` and `Purchase Date` to identify instances where a customer has purchased multiple product types on the same day. Then, I calculated the total price and quantity of products purchased on each day to compare it with the value provided in the `Total Purchase Amount` field. The result revealed that there is only one transaction per customer per day for each product type.\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Data Processing (PROCESS)\n\n#### **3.1 Tools used for analysis**\nFor this project, I'll use Python, along with its Pandas and Plotly packages, to perform my analysis.

Electronics has the highest return rate, whereas Books generate the lowest sales revenue.\n* Sales revenue consistently hovers around $51M per year with minor fluctuations.\n* February consistently records the lowest total sales, possibly due to fewer days, but not necessarily the lowest average monthly sales.\n* The return rate has remained consistently high at around 40% since 2020, potentially indicating issues with product satisfaction or quality.\n\n**Customer Segmentation based on CLV:**\n* The medium segment holds the majority of customers and generates the highest revenue, followed closely by the high segment.\n* Churn and return rates across all segments hover around 20% and 40%, respectively, with the medium segment exhibiting the highest rates.\n* Age distributions are similar across segments, with the highest concentration observed among customers aged 20-29.\n* The low segment shows a slightly higher usage of Cash, while the high segment exhibits a slightly higher preference for PayPal.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### **⦿ Business & Marketing Recommendations**\n\n**Targeted Marketing Strategies:**\n* Tailor marketing campaigns to different customer segments based on their purchasing behavior, CLV, and demographic characteristics like gender and age.\n  * Example: Create specific promotions for Home goods aimed at the 20-29 age group and Clothing for the 40-49 age group.\n* Offer personalized promotions, discounts, and messaging based on segment characteristics and purchasing behaviors to improve customer engagement and loyalty.\n* Introduce seasonal sales initiatives to offset slower or shorter months such as February and September.\n  * Example: Offer special discounts or curated product sets for Valentine's Day, catering to the holiday gift market.\n\n**Product & Quality Optimization:**\n* Utilize sales data and trends to optimize inventory management practices, ensuring adequate stock levels of high-demand/profit products such as Home and Clothing, while minimizing excess inventory for products with lower sales volumes. \n* Identify and address the root causes of high return rates, particularly for Electronics, to enhance product quality and customer satisfaction.\n* Implement bundling strategies to encourage larger purchases and increase revenue by offering complementary products at discounted rates.\n  * Example: Provide discounted bundles for purchasing multiple books from the same series. \n\n**Customer Retention and Loyalty Programs:**\n* Implement targeted customer retention initiatives such as loyalty programs or exclusive perks, to reduce churn rates and encourage repeat purchases. \n  * Example: Offer VVIP or member-exclusive benefits and rewards.\n* Focus on improving overall customer satisfaction by addressing issues related to product quality, customer service, and delivery experience, which could contribute to the high return rates.\n\n**Payment Method Optimization:**\n* Offer incentives or discounts for using credit cards, considering their slight prevalence over other payment methods. Collaborate with banks to offer credit card exclusive reward points or cashback offers.\n* Continue to enhance the payment experience by ensuring seamless integration of payment gateways and expand more digital payment options to cater to diverse customer preferences. \n  * Ex: offering intallment plans or accepting crypto-payments. \n\n**Performance Monitoring and Analysis:**\n* Establish regular performance monitoring measurements to track key metrics(KPIs) such as sales revenue, churn rates, return rates, and customer satisfactions.\n* Conduct regular quality checks and customer feedback surveys to address any issues promptly and continually improve overall customer experience.\n* Perform ongoing analysis and market research to identify emerging trends, patterns, and opportunities for product improvement or innovation.","metadata":{}}]}
