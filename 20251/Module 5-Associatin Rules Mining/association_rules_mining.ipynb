    "\n",
    "Association rule mining is a data mining technique used to uncover **if–then relationships** between items in large datasets, such as retail transaction logs. These relationships, known as **association rules**, capture patterns of items that frequently occur together (called **co-occurrences**).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of **market basket analysis**, association rules help answer questions like: *“Which products are often bought together?”* For example, suppose we find that 75% of customers who buy cereal also buy milk. We can express this as the rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\{\\mathrm{cereal}\\} \\Rightarrow \\{\\mathrm{milk}\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This rule suggests that customers who purchase cereal often purchase milk as well. Such insights can guide **marketing and retail decisions**, including promotional strategies, product bundling, and shelf placement.\n"
